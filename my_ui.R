        seriously will have more strict policies and more vaccines. We also want

        stringency and number of vaccinations administered. The strength and 
        direction of that correlation doesn't change much over time. This may 
        due to a lot of reasons. For example, we assumed that countries that 
        take COVID more seriously will have more stringent policies and more 
        vaccinations, but maybe countries that have reduced COVID cases by 
        stringent policies do not need vaccinations as much as others.")
